# Escape-Room-
The Github-project for Escape Room. Should include primarily code and Unity Projects.

# Guidelines
Try and follow standard format as specified and woork in accordance to Clean Code after best ability and everyone will be happy and satisfied.

# How do I use Git? 
Well, you can choose to either use the desktop app (it works well enough and doesn't give you much bullshit. You can't remove directories in it, though...) or you can try using the terminal (this is harder but you can do alot more).

You can use the Desktop App if you feel more comfortable with it, but you might have to use the terninal for certain operations (and if you wanna be badass). If you want to learn about the terminal, look over here: http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/common-git-commands.html


# Before you push/pull, do not: 
1. Have Unity open. It will give you an error-message. Shut off Unity and it will work awesomely.
2. Push any metadata. We have limited space on GitHub and if too much space is consumed git will get wonky.
3. Pull if you have made changes, it will whine. Try in that case to look over your changes and remove them.
4: Don't put everything into the master, work on your own branch first and then push unto master so that we can avoid all merge-conflicts.

# Golden Rules
Always remember to: 

- Pull, when you start your day. You're gonna have to look and see if any of your fellow programmers made some changes that you're gonna need.
- Add, when you've made changes so that you can store those and push (especially important if you're using the terminal).
- Commit, once you want to add and add a damn message so we know what you're done.
- Merge branches at the end of the week, so that we might solve whatever issuues arise at the same time. Don't just shove everything up the Master.
- Yell and disturb Chris when any solutions don't work. It's not like he has anything better to do.
